Bi-Branch Model

    First Branch - Feature Fusion Model
    Second Brach - Image Retrival Model

Feature Fusion Model

    Question are of 10 categories
    Question classified to 10 categories initially
    Question Feature extraction LSTM
    Image feature extraction using CNN
    Question can be open-ended or close-ended
    Seperate model for both
    Image features and Question Features fused(embedded) together and trained
    Classifer will give output

Image Retrival Model

    Labelled with answers of trained dataset.
    Find most suitable images matching to the input.
    optimal output will be genarated from that suitable images answers.
